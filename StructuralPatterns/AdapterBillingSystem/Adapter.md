## The adapter design pattern,acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
It achieves this by providing a wrapper class that converts one interface to another.
The adapter pattern operates on a few foundational principles:
## Separation of Concerns: It keeps the main business logic separate from the adapter’s interface conversion logic.
## Composition: The pattern often uses composition to integrate functionalities of the adaptee class.
## Target and Adaptee: There are two main players in this pattern. The ‘Target’ is the interface the client expects, and the ‘Adaptee’ is the existing interface that needs adapting.
